megbb(k-1, 0, rbar)

megbb(k, t, r)

  BASE CASES:
  0. if k < 0 || k == max_edges => can't backtrack, update solution if its better and return

  1. if nNodes == nEdges - r => it's optimal, update solution and return

  2. if exploring this path can't yield a more optimal solution than the current best return
  
  //forward move
  if(edge(k) in E)
    if an alternate path exists
       put k in EBAR
       if solution is better than optimal update it
       call megbb(k+1, t-1, r+1)
       put k in E       

  //backward move
  if (Edge(k) in EBAR)
     put k in E
     call megbb(k-1, t+1, r-1)
     put k in EBAR


  return;
